# pi-token-speed

A [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev/) extension that displays real-time **tokens-per-second (TPS)** performance metrics in the status bar while the AI is streaming responses.

## Features

- **Real-time TPS tracking** — measures token throughput as the assistant generates text and thinking content
- **Time-to-first-token (TTFT)** — measures latency from user message to the first token being generated
- **Configurable sliding window** — adjust the window size to suit your server speed (default: 1s)
- **Color-coded speed indicators** — visual feedback based on performance thresholds
- **Provider-reported counting** — opt in to using provider-reported counts (e.g. Anthropic, OpenAI) instead of the extension's own counter
- **Fully configurable** — customize display, thresholds and colors via `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`

## Speed Tiers

| Tier       | TPS   | Color              |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| 🟥 Slow    | 0–15  | `#ff4444` (red)    |
| 🟨 Medium  | 15–30 | `#ffaa00` (orange) |
| 🟩 Fast    | 30–45 | `#00ff88` (green)  |

## Installation

This package is a Pi extension. Install it with

```bash
npm install pi-token-speed
```

or

```bash
pi install https://github.com/gsanhueza/pi-token-speed
```

## Configuration

You can customize the display, speed thresholds and colors by adding a `tokenSpeed` section to your `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tokenSpeed": {
    "display": "tps",
    "tpsSlow": 0,
    "tpsMedium": 15,
    "tpsFast": 30,
    "tpsBlazing": 45,
    "colorSlow": "#ff4444",
    "colorMedium": "#ffaa00",
    "colorFast": "#00ff88",
    "colorBlazing": "#44ddff",
    "slidingWindow": 1000,
    "useProviderTokens": false,
    "countStrategy": "direct"
  }
}
```

| `countStrategy`     | `estimate`, `direct` | `direct`    | Token counting strategy used by the extension's own counter                  |

### Sliding Window

The sliding window determines how many recent tokens are used to calculate TPS. A larger window produces smoother readings at the cost of responsiveness; a smaller window reacts faster but can be noisier.

| Server speed        | Recommended window | Why                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast (30+ tok/s)    | `1000` (default)   | Plenty of tokens in the window — accurate and responsive  |
| Medium (5–30 tok/s) | `1000`–`3000`      | Enough tokens for stable readings                         |
| Slow (< 5 tok/s)    | `5000`–`15000`     | Captures more tokens, avoiding spiky or unreliable values |

For example, if your server streams at ~1 tok/s, a 10-second window gives ~10 tokens per window — enough for a reasonable calculation:

```json
{
  "tokenSpeed": {
    "slidingWindow": 10000
  }
}
```

### Provider Token Counts

By default, this extension uses its own token counter — the same engine behind `countStrategy`. As an alternative, you can opt in to using the provider's own reported counts instead:

| Value             | Behavior                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `false` (default) | Use this extension's own counter (controlled by `countStrategy`)                            |
| `true`            | Use the provider's reported counts instead; fall back to `countStrategy` when not available |

The extension's own counter is the default and always available. Enable `useProviderTokens: true` when your provider reports accurate token counts and you'd prefer to use them instead.

### Count Strategy

When `useProviderTokens` is `false` (default) or when the provider doesn't report counts, the `countStrategy` determines how the extension's own counter works:

| Strategy           | Behavior                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `direct` (default) | Counts each delta as 1 token        |
| `estimate`         | Approximates tokens from delta text |

The `direct` strategy preserves the original behavior. Use `estimate` when your server streams in small chunks — it approximates the real token count from the delta text, giving a more meaningful TPS reading.

## Commands

| Command | Description                                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/tps`  | Toggle display mode between `tps` (just the speed) and `full` (speed, token count, elapsed time, and TTFT) |

## How It Works

1. **Session Start** — Renders the initial status bar entry showing `⚡ TPS: --`
2. **Message Start** — When the assistant begins streaming, the engine starts tracking
3. **TTFT Measurement** — When the user message starts, a timer begins. The moment the first token (text, thinking, or tool call) is emitted, the elapsed time is recorded as the time-to-first-token (TTFT) in milliseconds
4. **Token Update** — Each text/thinking delta is recorded. If `useProviderTokens` is `true` and the provider reports token counts, those are used directly; otherwise the extension's own counter (controlled by `countStrategy`) is used
5. **Sliding Window** — TPS is calculated using a configurable time window of token timestamps
6. **Message End** — The authoritative token count (if available) is used to snap the total, ensuring the final average is exact
